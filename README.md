# creating-_DCGAN
created a DC_GAN using the MNSIT dataset
Use convolutions without any pooling layers

Use batchnorm in both the generator and the discriminator

Don't use fully connected hidden layers

Use ReLU activation in the generator for all layers except for the output, which uses a Tanh activation.

Use LeakyReLU activation in the discriminator for all layers except for the output, which does not use an activation
